This is an automated [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) API client.

Example use cases:

- Mass data imports.
- Seeding of GraphQL based services.
- Reset (deletion and re-import of data) of GraphQL based services.

Supported data formats:

- `JSON`
- `YAML`

The jobs are defined as JSON files whose syntax can be seen in a [test job](test/job3.json).

## Usage

The module mainly consists of two usable components.

### GraphQL Client

A wrapper around [graphql-request](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-request). It is used to connect to a GraphQL endpoint with custom headers and to parse resource files. Such resources are described in a JSON/YAML-based DSL and they are parsed to build mutations/queries.
It is possible to solely use the GraphQL Client if job automation is not required:

```js
import { Client } from 'gql-bot';
let gqlClient = new Client({
  entry: 'http://example.com/graphql',
  apiKey: 'apiKey',
  headers: { /* Custom HTTP headers */}
});

const mutation = fs.readFileSync('test/folder/createUsers.json');
const response = await gqlClient.post(mutation);
```

### Job Processor

The job processor implements a pipeline mechanism to process JSON-based job files, which can contain one or more tasks, which can be run concurrently or sequentially. The job can have different options such as the maximum number of concurrent tasks and each task contains useful information for the GraphQL Client, such as the file path filter (e.g: 'create*.json'), the desired operation or useful metadata. Currently, the only implemented operation is 'sync'.
There is a GraphQL-based processor, which performs calls to the GraphQL client and a generic processor, to which the GraphQL-specific processor is provided.

Example:

```js
import { GraphQLProcessor, JobProcessor, Job } from 'gql-bot';

const jobInfo = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./test/job1.json', 'utf8'));

// instantiating a job processor
jobInfo.options.processor = new GraphQLProcessor({
    entry: 'http://example.com/graphql',
    apiKey: 'apiKey'
  });
const jobProcessor = new JobProcessor(jobInfo);

// starting a job
const job = new Job(); // an extension of EventEmitter which can receive job-related options
job.on('progress', (task) => {
  console.log('Progress:', task.name, task.progress);
});
job.on('done', () => {
  done();
});
await jobProcessor.start(jobInfo, job);
```

Refer to [tests](test/) for more details.

## Events

The following events are issued by the `Job` object:

- `progress` (contains info specific with the task progress percentage and the task's description)
- `warn`
- `error`
- `done`
